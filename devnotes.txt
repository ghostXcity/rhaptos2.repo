I left code commented out in the pull request, and Michael rightly called me out
on it.  I am a messy programmer, recovering slowly, and so the commented code
will be pulled in here to be used / cribbed from later (yes, I know I can search
the git logs, but that gets painful quickly)



ACLs
----
This will be expanded in docs, however we now support sending and recving 
ACLs as a array in the module / folder / collection record.



Please see http://connexions.github.io/rhaptos2.repo/jsonflow.html
for examples





Logging
-------
statsdhandler logging:

  
#    statsd_host = config['globals']['bamboo_global']['statsd_host']
#    statsd_port = config['globals']['bamboo_global']['statsd_port']
#    statsd_handler = log.StatsdHandler(statsd_host, statsd_port)
    # formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s  "
    #                               "- %(request_id)s - %(user_id)s "
    #                               "- %(message)s")
    #statsd_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

I am not convinced the "extra" logger form is worthwhile
        logger.warn("Help",
                    extra={'statsd': ['rhaptos2.repo.module',
                                      'bamboo.foo.bar']})

Other logging 

I will setup a series of thread based tests to show if logging module barfs
trying to piece together logs of same root name in different threads / gevents/
If not then simplest logging problem is to set the root logger at startup and
have each module use its own version of the logger, igoring the
trying-to-pass-logger-around-via-imports issues.
