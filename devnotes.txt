COnverting away from original API design

4. create view content/api, and have it parse jhson and return a mediatype

1. remvoe URN style IDs and use just uuids
2. rename autosession to anonsession and remove tempsession
3. get_url will be redundant in testing

5. review how routers work - effectively we are repalcing the flask routing with our own.

scripts/models/content/inherits/base.coffee:
'application/vnd.org.cnx.module'
'application/vnd.org.cnx.folder'
'application/vnd.org.cnx.collection'

Further enhancements

'application/vnd.org.cnx.collection-v1.01'
  encode the desired version of schema

'application/vnd.org.cnx.collection+json'
  encode the desired format being sent / accepted

'application/vnd.org.cnx.collection-v1.01+json'
  full combo




We should register these somewhere AFAIK
